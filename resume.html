        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi! Iâ€™m Meera, an AI & Data Science student with a deep passion for technology, problem-solving, and innovation. Ever since I was introduced to coding, Iâ€™ve been fascinated by how we can use data to build intelligent systems that make life easier. I love working on projects that blend creativity with logic, whether it's developing predictive models, crafting intuitive web applications, or analyzing data to uncover meaningful insights.  </p>

<p>I have experience in Python, Java, machine learning, and web development, and Iâ€™m particularly interested in building AI-driven solutions that solve real-world challenges. My curiosity keeps me exploring new tools and technologies, and Iâ€™m always eager to take on new challenges that push my skills further.  </p>

<p>Beyond tech, I enjoy music, books, exploring new places, and learning about different cultures. I also have a strong appreciation for nature and believe in sustainable living. Whether itâ€™s through my academic journey or personal projects, my goal is to use technology in a way that positively impacts society.  </p>
